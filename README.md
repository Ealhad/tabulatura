# Tabulatura
Tabulatura is a guitar tabs manager for Android, along with a scraper for [Ultimate Guitar].

It is written in Kotlin, using [Anko], and distributed under the [GNU General Public License][gpl].

## Features

This is pretty much a work-in progress. The current features have been implemented:
 - searching tabs
 - displaying them
 - saving them for offline use

### To-do list
Things to do:
 - be pretty
 - be [reactive][rx]
 - better search system
 
When those goals are met, Tabulatura will probably be published on [F-Droid][fdroid].

#### Later
Things to do later: 
 - support more sources
 
## Contributing
Needless to say, contributions are welcome !
